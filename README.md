To view this project, download the files and use the Live Server extension. Start by opening the 'animation.html' file located in the '---Loading---' folder. 
Please note that the project is not responsive, so for the best experience, view it at a screen width of at least 1800px.

P.S. I made this project after 3 months of studying HTML/CSS, and I added JavaScript functionality independently, despite having no prior experience with it. Therefore, the majority of the work is focused on markup
